-------------------------------------

1: You need Temperest's code enabled (ENABLE_TEMPEREST=1 in settings.lua).
2: To work it, place mesecons (on) in the position x plus or minus 1 from the block.
3: Then punch, and off mesecons in the position y plus or minus 1 from the block will be powered.
4: Currently, you will have to dig the mesecons in the above positions up if the circuit changes, but that will be fixed.
5: The name of the block is mesecons_temperest:andblock.
6: Enjoy!
